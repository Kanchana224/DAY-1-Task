Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

* HTTP/1.1 (1997)                        * HTTP/2 (2015) 
  {Latenct:18ms }                          {Latency:19ms}
  {load time:2.37s}                        {Load time:1.20s}

MULTIPLEXING
   * HTTP/1.1:Uses a single request-response mechanism.Which means that each request must wait for the 
             previous one to complete before it can be processed.
   * HTTP/2  :Supports multiplexing allowing multiple request and responsed to be sent and received in 
             parallel over a single connection.This greatly improves the efficiency of data transfer.

HEADER COMPRESSION
   * HTTP/1.1:Header are sent as plain text leading to a lot of redundancy and wasted bandwidth.
   * HTTP/2  :Compresses headers reducing overhead and saving bandwidth,This is particularly beneficial
             for mobile and low bandwidth connections.

SERVER PUSH
   * HTTP/1.1:Clients need to explitly request each resource,Which can result in multiple round trips for
             a single page.
   * HTTP/2  :Supports server push where the server can send additional resources.(Eg:CSS,JS) to the Client
             before the client requests them improving page load times.

PRIORITIZATION
   * HTTP/1.1:Does not provide built-in support for prioritization requests.
   * HTTP/2  :Allows for stream prioritization so more important resources can be deleived first improving the 
             war experience.

CONNECTION HANDLING
   * HTTP/1.1:Requires multiple connections for parallel requests,which can lead ro resource contention and 
            increased letency.
   * HTTP/2  :Uses a single multiplexed connection reducing the overhead of managing multiple connection.

BINARY PROTOCOL
   * HTTP/1.1:Uses plain text for communication which is human readable but less efficient for machine.
   * HTTP/2  :Employs a binary protocol.Which is more efficient for parsing and processing by machine.
