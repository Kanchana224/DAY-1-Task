 Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

* Objects are a fundamental data structure in javascript,used for storing and organizing data.
* An object consists of key-value pairs where keys are string or symbols,and values can be of 
  any datatype.
* Javasript engines use the concepts of hidden classes and shapes to optimize object property 
  access and method calls.
* Hidden classes track an objects structure and properties, improving perfomance by assigning them
  a common class.
* The shape of an object is determined by its hidden class.Objects with the same hidden class have
  the same shape.
* Objects in Javascript can be accessed and manipulated through the prototype chain,enabling code
  reuse and inheritances.
* Understanding the internal representation of objects its crucial for writing efficient and performant
  Javascript code.
